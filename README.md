# NetflixVisualization
This project is to get familiar with data visualization tools such as matplotlib, seaborn, and PowerBI

# About the dataset
Dataset is taken from Kaggle and consists of features such as title, genre, date added, rating, type on over 8,000 movies
I applied data wrangling techniques such as cleaning and transforming the data to make it more usable for analysis.
I created these graphs using libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn and compared them to the graphs I created on PowerBI.
